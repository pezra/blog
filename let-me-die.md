At the [pool][paul-derda-pool-pic] the other day and she slipped off a
ledge she was standing on.  Her head went under water for maybe ten
seconds before I was able to get to her.  No sooner does she catch her
breath than she says "You were going to let me
dead[^conjugation-not-necessary]", in her most accusing voice.

If she can come up with that at this age I am a bit afraid of what she
will be saying in a couple of years.

[^conjugation-not-necessary]: She obviously does not always
conjugation "die" correctly yet.  That is not really surprising
because the very concept is only about a week or two old for her.

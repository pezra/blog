On my walk back to the office from lunch today I noticed the there was
a small [Novo Coffee][novo] sign in the window of the warehouse across
the street.  The name was familiar but I couldn't quite place it at the
time[^from-the-art-museum].  Given that the 
[coffee I had at work was getting a bit stale][stale] I decided that it was worth
investigating

I went in the open door and there before my eyes was a small batch
coffee roaster.  Inside I meet two very nice gentlemen, Pat and Herb,
who were very happy to help me.  Pat showed me around the operation,
and after a bit of discussion about the sort of coffees I like
suggested the San Rafael.  So I bought a pound and promptly went back
to the office and brewed a pot using my [new kit][coffee-kit].

It is an excellent coffee.  I think it might be a bit more interesting
if it were roasted a bit darker[^light-profile], but it is delicious
none the less.  I really like that there is an excellent coffee roaster
just a block from my office.  I may never have to endure stale coffee
again.


[^light-profile]: Apparently, Novo has a very light roasting profile.

[^from-the-art-museum]: Later I remembered that they have a coffee
shop at the [Denver Art Museum][dma].  I really enjoy the espresso I
had there the last time I went.

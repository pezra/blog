I just received my unemployment insurance debit card, the default
payment mechanism in Colorado.  After dutifully reading the fee
schedule i am appalled.  If you are out of work it is quite likely
that you need to make every penny count.  But the debit card carries
an obscene level of fees and usage charges.

Here are just a few of the most egregious ones.  

 * 10 cent surcharge on every purchase[^two-free]
 * 75 cents charge each time a transaction is denied due to insufficient funds[^down-is-good]
 * 50 cents for a ATM balance inquiry

[^two-free]: You do get 2 free POS signature transactions each month.
  That barely even counts as a fig leaf.

[^down-is-good]: The old "don't kick a man while he is down" adage is
  not given much weight in the banking industry, apparently.

I am ashamed that the Colorado Department of Labor willing subject
unemployed workers to this sort of treatment.  It is particularly
shocking because the debit card is strongly preferred as a payment
method for unemployment insurance.  The only other option is direct
deposit, but it really talked down in the sign-up process.

The debit card issuer obviously needs to be paid, but surely we can do
better than allowing Chase Bank to nickel and dime claimants every
time they use the money entitled to them.  Since a simple check is not
an option the least the Department of Labor could do to pay the card
issuer directly for their services, rather transferring that cost to
unemployed worker in the form of obscene usage fees.

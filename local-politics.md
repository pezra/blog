I am deeply interested in how we are governed.  By extension that
means that I pay an unfortunate amount of attention to politics.
Until recently, I use was a principled non-voter.  I did not vote
because I understood that my vote would have no impact what so ever on
the overall outcome.  

I still think that is largely true.  The national political system is
rigged such that only establishment players can win and once they do
their primary goals will 1) be to deliver what the bribers -- or
campaign contributors if you prefer that euphemism -- want and 2) to
maintain the status quo except where that interferes with goal number
1.  However, local politics are not quite so sterile and controlled.

I started voting again because of ballot measures.  These are
questions on which each vote makes an obvious and direct difference.
Now after voting for a few years again I realize that local politics
is probably a place where citizens could have a real impact, if only
they had enough information to do so.  For example, I usually have no
information about the candidates for local offices other than their
party affiliation.

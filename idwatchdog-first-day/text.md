Today is my first on the job at [ID Watchdog][idw].  

After the normal pleasantries of getting a desk, etc, i had the
pleasure of over hearing a conversation of some ops people in the
kitchen.  Apparently, a not so nice person provided the police with
the identity of one of our clients rather than his own.  A
fact which the ID Watchdog system detected.  Now the ops team is
working with law enforcement and the Judaical system to cleared up the
confusion.  A standard part of the service we provide, apparently.

I am sycked to be working at a place that helps people in such
concrete ways.

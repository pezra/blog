title: An explanation of blame and guilt

I just read [Blame Turned Upside Down][eog-blame][^hat-tip] by Robert
Wright.  I don't think i have ever felt quite so uncomfortable while
reading as i did during that essay.  Its thesis is easy to apply to
daily life and it quite handily explains the reactions of myself, and
others, to many situations i have experienced.  It is profoundly
discomforting that people's behaviors and feelings are dominated by a
set of ancient heuristics.  Particularly when that person is me.

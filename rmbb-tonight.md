The [Rocky Mountain Blogger Bash][rmbb] is tonight and I will be
there.  [Cat][cat] and I are even on the official RSVP list (which
means we get free drinks).  This is my only concession to the
[convention][dnc] but any gathering of "beer-swigin'" bloggers has to
be fun.  If you are going too let me know and I will keep an eye out
for you.

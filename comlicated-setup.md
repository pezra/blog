Microservices are the current fad in the industry. I have been a long time advocate of using services to modularize large systems but the approach not perfect. It solves some (big) problems and creates a few problems of its own. Being really complicated to setup is one common issue for service based architectures. In a monolithic app we usually solve this problem with seed data and a setup script. With those two things we can usually get the app up and running quickly.

In a service based architecure a setup script is a bit harder to do. To start with there are now serveral code bases to setup. The developer really only cares about the one she is trying to work on but all the other (probably) have to be working correcty too. If the system is using the REST style (which is should be) then there is the added problems that a lot of the data each component actually links to resources in other components. If not managed thoughtfully this can lead to order dependences in setup and make it hard to create setup scripts.

I recently read [Anathem][anathem]{.item .url .fn} by [Neal
Stephenson][].  Overall, I give it a <span class="rating">4</span> out
of 5 -- an excellent read.  It is <span class="summary">an
interesting story presented at a reasonable pace and, most
importantly, it introduce me to a couple of intriguing ideas.</span>  I
definitely scrimped a bit on my sleep while I read it, not
something I often do.  Unfortunately, it does have one major
flaw.

Neal Stephenson has a gift for, or perhaps an obsession with,
explaining interesting and complex math and science topics in his
books.  That is one of the thing I like about reading them.  In
"Anathem" these topics -- namely [configuration spaces][config-spaces] and the
[many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics][many-worlds] -- are presented in
appendices, but in the same voice as main story.  I like this approach
a bit better than when they appear in the middle of the story.  It
makes the material accessible without distracting from the plot.

That major flaw I mentioned earlier... It is just too freakin' long.
935 pages to be exact.  Really?  He need almost a thousand pages to
tell this story?  It is a good story but would be a better book if it
2/3s, or better yet, half, as long.  Most of Stephenson's recent work
is about this length.  He must like this format.  I just cannot help
thinking that after he got famous his editors have gone soft and that
has not improved his books.

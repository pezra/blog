I am on the job market again.

If you needs some help exposing your applications functionality via
REST web APIs, we should talk.  If you need some assistance
developing, deploying and managing a Ruby application, I have the
skills you need.  If you need someone that can learn your code base
and your business processes, I can do that.  If you need someone to
drive improvements to you software development process, I won't
disappoint you.

My [resume](/blog/mediapeter-williams.pdf) has more details on my
skills and accomplishments.  Feel free to pass it around to anyone you
think might be interested.

There are somethings we do under the pretense of being useful that are
actually harmful.  Unscheduled stories and bug reports in your ticket
tracking system, are one example.

Creating a ticket is easy when you are in the moment.  However, once
produced these artifacts have to be read and understood multiple times
in the future.  Each time you read a ticket it costs time.  How many
times have you given up trying to find some ticket that you think you
wrote a long time ago and just entered a new one?  How much time have
you spent sifting through the same tickets every iteration deciding
repeatedly that they are not important enough to actually schedule?

I am not saying that you should not enter tickets in your issue
tracker.  I am saying that doing so is *not* free.  Therefore, you
should consider very carefully whether the story or bug you are about
to write will have a net positive value over the life of the project.
Most likely it will not.

My rule of thumb is this: do not write it down unless you are willing
to schedule it right now.

Willingness to schedule a bit of work is proxy for it's importance.
It is easy to pretend everything is top priority, but if you are not
willing prioritize a bit of work before something you have already
decided you want it is obviously not very important.

### If it is important you will not forget

I think the idea that you will forget something important is scariest
part of this approach.  That fear is just silly.  If you are
passionate about an idea you will not forget it.  If it is important
to your customers they will not let you forget it.

Let me ask you a question: if neither you nor the customers care
enough about an issue to get it on the schedule should be you
expending effort on it?

To me the answer is clearly no.  If you see a potential issue or have
an idea let it rest until it become important.  Odds are it never will
become important and you will have saved a good deal of every ones
time.  If it ever does become important the fact that six months ago
you wrote a ticket vaguely related to issue people are having now will
not help anyway.  You probably will not even be able to find that old
ticket.

### Corollary: todo comments considered extra harmful

Notice that my rule of thumb basically rules out todo comments
altogether.  Every todo comment is not only an unscheduled story, but
an unscheduleable story.  Even if the todo comment where a story in
the ticketing system it would never, ever be scheduled.  If it had a
chance the developer would have probably written story instead.

Todo's are far worse than mere unshecheduled stories.  Todo comments
are a way for the developer to transfer some of the weight of the
decisions that they made to future generations.  A tax, in effect, on
future generations of developers in order to assuage the author's
insecurities regarding decisions they have made in the code.

To the authors of todo comments i say, own your decisions.  If you are
not sure of what to do get a second pair of eyes now.  What ever you
do, don't burden future developers with your indecision.  Right or
wrong it will work out better if you make a reasonable decision and
own it until there is some evidence that it was wrong.

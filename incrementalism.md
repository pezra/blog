One of the hardest won lessons of my career is the power of incrementalism. I am, at my core, an idealist. When look at a product or code base i tend to see the ways it deviates from my ideals, rather than the ways it is useful or does match my ideals. 

This tendency is a powerful motivator to produce elegant code and good products. I suspect it is one of the reasons i became a really good software developer. It does have its dark side though. Overcoming some of the weaknesses of my idealism is an ongoing theme in my life. Most importantly idealism makes developing a sense of "good enough" very difficult. 

Getting a intuitive feel of what constitutes "good enough" is probably one of the most important skills any engineer can develop. An almost sure sign of an underdeveloped sense of good enough is the big rewrite. Early in my career is was involved in a couple of big rewrites. Both were successful, at least from a technical perspective, but both were a complete failure from business perspective. They took too long and provide any immediate value to the customer.

In both cases i was crucial in convincing the business to do the big rewrite.

In the intervening years i have come to realize that, to use a football analogy, real progress is made 4 yards at a time. If you want a successful product, or a nice code base you will get it one small improvement at a time.

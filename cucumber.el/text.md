I have been working pretty extensively with [Cucumber][] for the last
couple of weeks.  In short, it is killer and you should be using it.

Using Cucumber completely removes responsibility for proving the
system works from the [Respect][] spec or unit tests.  This in frees
those tests up to do what they do best: help you design good
interfaces to, and assert non-obvious things about, individual units
of the system.

If you are using [Emacs][] i suggest [cucumber.el][].  It has
excellent support for editing [Gherkin][] files.  I did miss having
convenient key bindings to test the features i am working on, though.
(I have gotten use to that with [rspec-mode]

Happy third birthday Audrey!  We had a great day today.  First, we got
up late -- well, I did anyway, and Elliot and Audrey played together
nicely while I caught a few extra Zs -- and opened presents.  The red
headed Cabbage Patch doll is the favorite as of this evening, but the
Lego were a close second.

Then we went to [A Taste of Colorado][taste-of-co] where we ate good
food and rode fun rides.  Audrey was quite adventurous with rides
today.  She particularly likes the ones she can go on by her herself.
Now that she is three I guess parents just weigh her down.

Of course, this evening we had cake and sang Happy Birthday to Audrey.
Audrey really likes to be sung to.  I have rarely see such a big grin
as the one we got during our rendition of Happy Birthday.  She was
very proud of being able to blow out the candles, as you can see
below.  At bed time, she even claimed that the candles where her
favorite thing today.

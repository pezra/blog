I started my new gig, at [brightkite][], today.  I am super stoked to
be working with the excellent crew there.

I realized that I need some new music, though. I have quite a lot
of music that I associate strongly with particular events, workplaces,
teams and even books[^garbage-2_0-illuminatus].  My tastes range from
pop with a decent beat, to dub, to pretty much anything involving a
piano.  For example, recently have been listening to 
[Silversun Pickups][carnavas] (thanks to [Donnie][donnie-carnavas]), 
[Ben Folds][supersunny], [Burial][untrue], and 
[Pitch Black][rude-mechanicals].  But most of my music library is 
already saturated with emotion.  I need some new music.

So I am ask you, my readers, for some suggestions of some new music I
can associate with my new opportunity.  Point me at some of your
favorite music.


[^garbage-2_0-illuminatus]: You really could not find a better sound
track to [The Illuminatus! Trilogy][illuminatus] than [Garbage
2.0][gargage-2_0].  That album was the one on my [Nomad][] (see figure
5 in the linked page) when I started reading it and two went together
so well I stuck with it for the entire book.
